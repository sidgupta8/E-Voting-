# E-Voting-

📍I have used here Java as Server side Programming Language in (Servlet , JSP) , HTML , CSS , JS , AJAX , JQUERY (Sweetalert Popups) and Oracle Database to store the data.

👉Online voting has become one of the new systems that are considered as an appropriate way to make the voting more convenient and , it is expected to increase citizen’s participation on the election. This system has been referred to as a more challenging than other electronic commerce or electronic government application with regard to network security and data encryption.
👉Online voting, on the other hand gives a large opportunity to vote from any point where Internet access is available such as home, school, office or even shopping mall . Using online voting can reduce the time people need to vote. This means that citizen can vote without loss their time and avoid along queuing of voter which identified as the biggest problem of every election. Citizens can vote without going to the polls and may be this is the efficient way to encourage people’s participation on Election Day.
👉Another crucial point regarding election process is that sometimes people just pick up the names that they are familiar with or simply think sound nice and voting on the basis of  party affiliation rather than candidate’s qualification. This probably due to the fact that they have a minimum level of information about the candidates and the party which have to be chosen. In order to solve this problem the online voting has been able to provide the voter with more information about the candidates or related issues that are on the ballots.

📍Admin and candidate both are provided with certain features i.e. (Admin can move to various Admin options like Manage Candidate i.e. add,update,show,delete candidate or can manage user i.e. show or remove user details or can show the result (candidate , gender , party )wise and can even move to voting page to cast his own vote).
📍Each user can cast his vote only once.
📍No 2 candidates from the same party can take part in election from the same area.
📍This system also shows to which candidate you have casted your vote.
